# gj :: codeSpex

This extension shows coding help using VS Code's commenting feature.

## Use

1. Open an InterSystems class file, routine or CSP file. Code coloring and other language features will be handled by the [InterSystems Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=intersystems.language-server) extension, a dependency of this extension.

2. When comment buttons appear in the gutter, click on them. Alternatively, look for entries in a 'Comments' tab in the VS Code Panel.

3. When expanded each comment offers action buttons:
- 'Mute' to remove it for the current session. It will reappear when the document is reloaded.
- 'Resolve' to change its status. The Comments view shows a different icon on resolved entries, and its filter control allows resolved items to be hidden.
- 'Exclude' to update workspace or global settings with entries or patterns that should not be commented about in future.
